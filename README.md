# Swagware Loader
This loader is a cheat loader written in C#. Remember that this is just an example and nothing more.

## Information
This is a example loader made in c#, php, js, and css. It has manual map injection using the bleak library, auth system, anti debug/tamper, auto updater, and more.

## Setup
If you get a lot of errors when you first open the project than it means you don't have the proper framework installed. To fix this go to visual studio installer and click "modify", go to individual components and than find .net framework 4.6.1. Once installed you shouldn't get any errors.
